## Command line options

```html
Capture target options (use one of the following):
    -captureall                Record all processes (default).
    -process_name [exe name]   Record specific process specified by name.
    -process_id [integer]      Record specific process specified by ID.
    -etl_file [path]           Consume events from an ETL file instead of a running process.

Output options:
    -no_csv                    Do not create any output file.
    -output_file [path]        Write CSV output to specified path. Otherwise, the default is
                               PresentMon-PROCESSNAME-TIME.csv.

Control and filtering options:
    -scroll_toggle             Only record events while scroll lock is enabled.
    -hotkey                    Use F11 to start and stop recording, writing to a unique file each time.
    -delay [seconds]           Wait for specified time before starting to record. When using
                               -hotkey, delay occurs each time recording is started.
    -timed [seconds]           Stop recording after the specified amount of time.  PresentMon will exit
                               timer expires.
    -exclude_dropped           Exclude dropped presents from the csv output.
    -terminate_on_proc_exit    Terminate PresentMon when all instances of the specified process exit.
    -simple                    Disable advanced tracking (try this if you encounter crashes).
    -dont_restart_as_admin     Don't try to elevate privilege.
    -no_top                    Don't display active swap chains in the console window.
